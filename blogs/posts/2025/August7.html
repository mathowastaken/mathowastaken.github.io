            <h2>whoami</h2>
            <p>
                I am Tȟóšá (tow sa meaning purple) Matȟó (ma tow meaning bear).
                I have just graduated with my 2 year in IT and I am currently
                looking for a job. In my free time I like to run, play video
                games, code and self host. I wanted to start this blog because I
                thought it would be a good way to hold myself accountable.
            </p>

            <h2>
                <s><i>Distro</i></s> Language Hopping
            </h2>
            <p>
                Throughout college I found a passion for coding but I could
                never remain consistent and every time I returned I tried a
                different lanaguage. I wouldn't say I got to experience these
                lanaguages fully as I never created any real projects other than
                terminal calculators and other basic CLIs. As for the languages
                I "tried" I started with Python then went onto C#, C++, C, Lua
                (OMG BRAZIL MENTIONED!), Java, Rust and Go. There are probably
                some others I am forgetting but you name it I probably touched
                it (pause).
            </p>
            <p>
                As for why I was inconsistent, I belive it was because I was
                terrible at coding (still am just not as bad). I would watch
                people code and they knew how to solve a problem without even
                giving a second thought. I thought all programmers just read
                some books and knew all the answers to every problem. Now I
                FINALLY understand this is not the case.
            </p>
            <p>
                I now see programming as more of a puzzle. For example more
                experienced developers with years of experience have collected
                more puzzle pieces than developers who have just started. So
                when they come across a problem they know what piece goes where,
                because they have done it before.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since July I have started to make an effort to be more
                consistent because I relaize I can't become better without the
                pieces. With this in mind I came to the conclusion that my
                language hopping needed to stop. My descsion for which language
                to stick with was between Rust and Go and I ended up choosing Go
                because of the rich standard library and strong community.
            </p>

            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <p>
                I have just finished up my first project, Tamago, which was way
                out of my comfort zone. Tamago is a small CLI fetch tool that
                fetches data from my local Gitea server API. This project was
                overall pretty fun and challenging. Halfway through the project
                I randomly decided to research and configure golangci-lint and
                spent hours fixing issues with my code that it had pointed out.
                In the end I learned how to make GET requests, read and write to
                a JSON file, handle command line arguments and some other small
                things.
            </p>
            <p>
                For my next project I have a couple of ideas in mind. Im
                deciding between a discord bot, another CLI but for Proxmox but
                with a real use case or a small terminal based game. I am also
                starting to tinker with Godot, but we will see how that goes.
            </p>

            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>
                I have a couple of goals in mind. Number one is to create a new
                blog post once a month so I can remain accountable. Number two
                is to make games but not in Godot. I would prefer to use a lower
                level language and a framework like SDL3 or Vulkan. I think I
                would find the process more fufilling when creating the games at
                that level. It would also be nice to find a group of people that
                I can do this with.
            </p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>This is only the begining.</p>
